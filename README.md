```yaml
dependencies:
  explain_features_tutorial: ^0.1.1
```

Then run: 
```bash
    flutter pub get
```

and import the package where needed:

final List<GlobalKey<State<StatefulWidget>>> allKeys = [
  buttonKey,
  textKey,
];

ExplainFeaturesTutorial(
  widgetKeys: allKeys,
  widgetExplainerText: const [
    'This is the action button',
    'This is some important text',
  ],
  child: Scaffold(
    appBar: AppBar(
      actions: [
        IconButton(
          key: buttonKey,
          icon: Icon(Icons.star),
          onPressed: () {},
        ),
      ],
    ),
    body: Center(
      child: Text(
        'Welcome!',
        key: textKey,
        style: TextStyle(fontSize: 20),
